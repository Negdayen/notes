#+title: GNU Debugger (GDB)

* Record and Replay

GDB has support for reverse debugging, but in practice recording seems to take a very long
time.  Gambit has been recording for over 24 hours and I don't know if it's making any
progress.

* Example calling malloc from GDB

#+begin_example
(gdb) set $x = malloc(sizeof(___S16))
(gdb) call ___SCMOBJ_to_S16(___GET_PSTATE(),___FIX(10L),$x,1)
(gdb) print * (___S16 *) $x
$18 = 10
#+end_example
