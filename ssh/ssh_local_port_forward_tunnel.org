#+title: Secure Shell (SSH) Local Port Forward Tunnel

* Secure Shell (SSH) Local Port Forward Tunnel

With [[id:8bdf16c9-0639-4f7e-8872-d05df060a087][SSH]], you can allocate a port locally that proxies traffic through a secure shell
connection to another destination from that remote host.

I.E. If you have a =node-b= that can be accessed from =node-a=, you can access =node-b=
locally through =node-a=, assuming you have SSH access to =node-a=.

#+begin_src sh
ssh -L "${local_port}:${node_b_address}:${node_b_port}" "${ssh_user}@${node_a_address}"
#+end_src
