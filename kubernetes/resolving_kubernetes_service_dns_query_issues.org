#+title: Resolving Kubernetes Service DNS Query Issues

* kube-proxy not running on node caused issues with Kubernetes Service DNS query resolution

A specific worker node within a Kubernetes cluster was not able to resolve cluster-level
[[id:4b0100a2-7fc2-46c0-84ed-9ca6338ac640][DNS]] queries.  Any time a container running running on this node tried to connect to
another [[id:b8be55e6-9cc6-48da-8bce-772503f1d21d][Kubernetes Service]], it would fail.  Containers running on this node would try to
communicate with the =kube-dns= service using its service IP address but would fail.

On further inspection, this node's =kube-proxy= was not running.  Starting =kube-proxy=
resolved issues in establishing a connection to =kube-dns=, which in turn resolved errors
with containers on this node resolving hostnames.
